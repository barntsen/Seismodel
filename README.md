# Seismic modeling
  This directory contains slides for four lectures on modeling of
  seismic waves. The lectures use little or no mathematics
  and are suitable for the general geoscience student.

  The links below points to pdf's which should render on any 
  pdf reader. Some of the slides also contain mp4 movies, which
  may not render automatically, depending on the pdf reader.
  All mp4 movies have been provided and the slides using the movies
  are equipped with the file name of the mp4 files (usually 
  at the bottom of the slides).

  Although the pdf's will render directly on github, its is best
  to download the entire directory either by cloning (if you have
  github installed on your pc) or by clicking on the green "code"
  button and selecting the option to download as a zip file.
